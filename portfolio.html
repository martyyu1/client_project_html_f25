                    <strong>Do I really need a portfolio?</strong><br>
                    For most UMSI tracks and roles in information, a professional online portfolio is strongly recommendedâ€”even required for some programs or employers. It's the best way to showcase what you can do, in your own words and style.

                <li>
                    <strong>What should I include in my portfolio?</strong><br>
                    Focus on high-quality work samples (class projects, internships, volunteer work), your process, and brief reflections on what you learned or accomplished.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Should I create a digital or physical portfolio?</strong><br>
                    A digital portfolio is often more versatile and accessible, but consider your audience and the context in which you'll be presenting it.

                <li>
                    <strong>How often should I update my portfolio?</strong><br>

                </li>
